      BraveNewCoin uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g. A  required parameter was missing). Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with BraveNewCoin's servers (these will be rare).

      Some `4xx` errors that could be handled programmatically include an error code that briefly explains the error reported.
      ```
      {
        "status": "BAD_REQUEST",
        "timestamp": "2018-08-14T21:55:46.055Z",
        "message": "validation error",
        "errors": [

            "rejectedValue": "ERROR",
            "message": "Invalid value provided for status"
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

      ### HTTP status code summary
      HTTP Code                          | Description
      -----------------------------------|------------
      200 - OK                           | Everything worked as expected
      400 - Bad Request                  | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.
      401 - Unauthorized                 | No valid OAuth2 token provided
      404 - Not Found                    | The requested resource doesn't exist
      409 - Conflict                     | The request conflicts with another request (perhaps due the resource was updated)
      429 - Too Many Requests            | Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an expontential backoff of your requests.
      500, 502, 503, 504 - Server Errors | Something went wrong on BraveNewCoin's end. (These will be rare).

      ### Handling Errors
      Our API libraries raise exceptions for many reasons, such as invalid parameters, authentication errors, and network unavailability. We recommend writing code that gracefully handles all possible API exceptions.
    x-traitTag: true
  - name: Pagination
    description: |
      All top-level API resources have support listing all resources which they hold. For instance, you can [list assets](#operation/listAssets), [list markets](#operation/listMarkets) and [list exchanges](#operation/listExchanges) etc. These list API methods share a common structure and where BraveNewCoin determines the number of resources is too large, the list APIs have the ability to take at least these two parameters: `size` and `startAfter`.

      BraveNewCoin API's utilise cursor-based pagination using the `startAfter` parameter. The parameter should be a existing object ID and returns resources in reverse chronological order. The `startAfter` parameter returns resources listed after the named resource. For APIs which take both a `startAfter` and `timestamp` parameters, the `timestamp` is ignored if `startAfter` is provided.

      Arguments     |                         | Description
      ----------------------------------------|------------
      limit         | Optional, default is 10 | A limit on the number of resources to be returned, between 1 and 2000.
      startAfter    |                         | A cursor for use in pagination. startAfter is an resource ID that defines your place in the list.
      timestamp     |                         | The timestamp to start searching from.

      List Response Format | Description
      ---------------------|------------
      content              | An array containing the actual response elements, paginated by any request parameters.
      nextId               | The value to be provided in the `startAfter` to get the next page.
  - name: Timezones
    description: |
      BraveNewCoin APIs will return datetime values in ISO8601 format. Datetime values are always returned in UTC time (as indicated by the `Z` at the end of the datetime value).

      Currently BraveNewCoin APIs only accept datetimes in query parameters and request bodies which are in UTC.
  - name: Versioning
    description: |
      When we make backwards-incompatible changes to the API, we will release a new version. The current version is **v3**, for more information regarding changes see the [API changelog](#tag/Versioning)

      The following changes are considered backwards-compatible:
        * Adding new API resources
        * Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods
        * Adding new properties to existing API responses
        * Changing the order of properties in existing API responses
        * Changing the length or format of object IDs or other opaque strings
